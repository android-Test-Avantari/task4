/*********************************** Task4 ***************************************/
Approach:
Just install and open the Apk file and you will find one floating button. Click on that button to change the current card. On next card, you will find small button on upper left corner that will help you to go back to home card.
Background processing:
What I did in this task is just created a Relative Layout and applied it shadow and some other properties. Next I just used Frame layout, in that I used two Relative layouts one for each card and a button to switch between cards.
For counter, I used threads to increase and decrease counter. And I also applied different transitions and animation on different components.
