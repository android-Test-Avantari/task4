/*********************************** Task2 ***************************************/
Approach:
Just install and open the apk file and you will find two buttons.
First button is labelled as click to view all words that will show all the stored words in a ListView.
Second button is labelled as click to store all words that will fetch and store all words in SQLite table.
After storing words to local storage, it will also show minimum time among all submissions of each html file to local storage in a TextView.
Background processing:
What I did in this task is just retrieved all the text (HTML text) of each html file as a string and extracted the required information using regular expressions.
I fetched the html text in async background process and after fetching each html file, I stored the extracted words in local storage that is SQLite database.
During submission to local storage I just ran a thread in background to calculate the execution time that is minimum among all the submission. At the end, I have displayed the exc_time in a TextView.
I also retrieved the words with their speeches and meanings from local storage and displayed them in a ListView.
